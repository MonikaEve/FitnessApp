        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Being healthy and fit plays an ever increasing role in peoples lifes. However there are various reasons and
            factors that cause people to not work out as regularly as they desire to. The goal is to design a smartphone
            app which will help people to improve their fitness.
            The target group is people who want to exercise more, but who -for various reasons - don't get around to it.
         </p>
        <h2>My role</h2>
        I am the project initiator and I will wear many hats during this design process.
        My main responsibilities include:
         <ul>
             <li>User Research</li>
             <li>Persona creation</li>
             <li>Problem definition</li>
             <li>Hosting and facilitating meetings for team related activites</li>
             <li>Prototype creation</li>
             <li>Testing</li>
         </ul>

    <section id="approach">
    <h2>Approach: Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>This case study follows along the design thinking process as tought in the <a
        href="https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/design-thinking-the-beginner-s-guide">Design Thinking - The
        Beginner's Guide</a>
        by the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">The Interaction Design Foundation</a> as displayed in the
        image below. </p>
        <img src="https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/5808b55608af6.jpg"
        alt="5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process">
        <p>The Design Thinking process follows covers five stages: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. During the Empathize stage designers 
            perform user research in order to gain an empathetic understanding of the users desires and needs.
            This data is turned into a definite problem statement during the Define stage. A clearly defined problem enables the Ideate stage. During this stage the team
            comes together to brainstorm possible solutions for the problem. The team decides on a possible solution and creates one or more 
            prototypes during the Prototype phase. The prototype(s) are given to a selected user group to test. The tests should generate further insights about the users needs as well as desires and
            initiate design changes. </br>
            The design thinking process is an iterative process and the steps don't necessarly have to be followed in sequence.
            However the appropriate steps should be iterated through until the team comes up with a satisfying design. </br>
            This process is ideal for startups and therefore it was chosen for this project.
        </p>
        <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: To ensure that all data gathered during this design process stays confidential I have omitted
        and appropriated confidential information.</p>

        <h2>Empathise - The discovery phase</h2>

        alt="Empathise stage of the design thinking process">
        <p>The goal is to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem I am trying to solve.
            To gain this knowledge I need to understand people's needs, thoughts, emotions as well
            motivations that drive them towards improving their fitness.
        </p>
        <h3>Interviews with potential users</h3>
        <p>The empathize stage was an explorative effort, that allowed me to gather as much information as possible, through interviews with potential users of the fitness app.
            By combining interviews with research on social media I was able to gather diverse data about people who want to improve their fitness.
        </p>
        <p>In order to find interviewees, from various backgrounds, I have reached out to my family and friends as well as to people on social media. 
            I have found participants for the interview in a facebook group for women who want a 
            makeover for their health and fitness, as well as in my personal circle. The aim of each interview was to answer the following main questions:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Why</strong> people <strong>want to</strong> exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when they <strong>do</strong> manage to exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when something <strong>prevents</strong> them from
                    exercising?</li>
            </ol>
            During the actual interviews I have asked more than those three questions. How many and which questions exactly, depended on the individual interviewee.
            However all questions aimed to result in answers to the above mentioned three main questions.  
        </p>  
        <p>In addition to the interviews I searched  for people who documented their fitness story on instagram or twitter. The purpose of the social media search was 
            to  find more data about how people motivate themselves to stick to a workout routine and what challenges they were facing during the beginning of their journey.
        <p>The data collected during the interviews, as well as social media reserch, was used to create
                <a href="#persona1">Personas</a> (fictional characters), which are described in the <a href="#define">Define section</a>.</p>    
        <p class="highlight-text">I used personas constantly throughout the project to guide design decisions,
            priorities, and create empathy amongst the client and the team.

        <p>The goal is to develop a clear understanding of <strong>which problem I will attempt to solve for the potential users</strong>. <br>
        The define phase includes the following activities:
       </p>
       <ul>
           <li>Affinity Diagramm: Analyze and identify the major themes in the data</li>
           <li>Empathy Map: Find out how participants think, feel, talk and react</li> 
            <li>Define Personas Point of view to crystalize their needs</li>
            <li>Persona creation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
     
        <img id="affinity-diagram" src="./img/AffinityDiagram.jpg" alt="Affinity Diagramm of the data collected during user interviews">
        <p>I clustered the data from the user interviews into the following main groups: 
            <ol>
                <li>Underlying health issue: Workout relieves the pain</li>
                <li>Vanity: People who work out to look good</li>
                <li>Agility: People who want to maintain their agility throughout their lifes</li>
                <li>Schedule: People workout when they have a schedule and stick to it</li>
                <li>Lack of commitment: People skip workouts, because they let things get in the way</li>
                <li>Environmental restrictions: Sometimes a workout is skipped, because of weather, or it would disturb others, etc.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>In order to crystalize the users needs, I have formulated "Point of view" statements, for the following needs.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Help prioritizing things that need to be done in a week, including workouts</li>
            <li>Ability to engage and commit socially</li>
            <li>Reminder of their goals</li>
        </ol>
        <h4> 1. Schedule and prioritze what needs to be done in a week (including workouts) </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>User:</strong> Someone who works from 9-5, 5 days a week. Has social and other commitments. Takes care of organizational tasks that come with life. </br>
            <strong>Need:</strong> To find time to exercise during a workday. </br>
            <strong>Insights:</strong> User skips a workout in order to do other stuff, like taking care of organizational tasks, meeting friends, or things the person feels like doing at that moment. </br>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Point of View: </strong></br>
        As someone who works full-time and has an acitive social life I need to give workouts a higher priority, because I tend to let things get in the way of my workouts.
        </p>
        <p>This point of view is made actionable by the following <strong>"how might we" </strong> questions:
            <ul>
                <li>How might we help a full-time employee to prioritize what needs to be done after work?</li>
                <li>How might we come up with a reminder of why they want to work out?</li>
                <li>How might we help someone who feels like there is not enough time to work out?</li>
                <li>How might we help someone who feels like he or she has no energy left to work out at the end of the day?</li>
                <li>How might we come up with a motivator to work out, despite lacking energy?</li>
                <li>How might we come up with a motivator to work out, when lethargy kicks in?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>2. Ability to engage and commit socially</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>User:</strong> Someone who works out, but is not an integral part of a team. </br>
            <strong>Need:</strong> Ability to engage socially and commit to goals via an app </br>
            <strong>Insights:</strong> People find it helpful to connect to others and make commitments as as well as share their success.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Point of View:</strong></p>
        As someone who also likes to work out on my own terms, I need the ability to commit to my goals, because
        it gives me the feeling that other people care and I enjoy seeing other people's succees.
        <p>This point of view is made actionable by the following <strong>"how might we" </strong> questions:
        <ul>
            <li>How might we make enable to easily connect with their friends on our app?</li>
            <li>How might we enable users to share their workout success?</li>
            <li>How might we make it easy for people to define realistic goals</li>
            <li>How might we enable our users to commit to those goals?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
