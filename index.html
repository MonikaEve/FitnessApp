        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Being healthy and fit plays an ever increasing role in peoples lifes. However there are various reasons and
            factors that cause people to not work out as regularly as they desire to. The goal is to design a smartphone
            app which will help people to improve their fitness.
            The target group is people who want to exercise more, but who -for various reasons - don't get around to it.
        </p>
        <h2>My role</h2>
        I am the project initiator and I will wear many hats during this design process.
        My main responsibilities include:
        <ul>
            <li>User Research</li>
            <li>Persona creation</li>
            <li>Problem definition</li>
            <li>Hosting and facilitating meetings for team related activites</li>

            <li>Testing</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="approach">
        <h2>Approach: Design Thinking</h2>
        <p>This case study follows along the design thinking process as tought in the <a
                href="https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/design-thinking-the-beginner-s-guide">Design Thinking -
                The
                Beginner's Guide</a>
            by the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">The Interaction Design Foundation</a> as displayed in
            the
            image below. </p>
        <img src="https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/5808b55608af6.jpg"
            alt="5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process">
        <p>The Design Thinking process follows covers five stages: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. During
            the Empathize stage designers
            perform user research in order to gain an empathetic understanding of the users desires and needs.
            This data is turned into a definite problem statement during the Define stage. A clearly defined problem
            enables the Ideate stage. During this stage the team
            comes together to brainstorm possible solutions for the problem. The team decides on a possible solution and
            creates one or more
            prototypes during the Prototype phase. The prototype(s) are given to a selected user group to test. The
            tests should generate further insights about the users needs as well as desires and
            initiate design changes. </br>
            The design thinking process is an iterative process and the steps don't necessarly have to be followed in
            sequence.
            However the appropriate steps should be iterated through until the team comes up with a satisfying design.
            </br>
            This process is ideal for startups and therefore it was chosen for this project.
        </p>

            I have omitted

        <h2>Empathise - The discovery phase</h2>

            alt="Empathise stage of the design thinking process">
        <p>The goal is to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem I am trying to solve.
            To gain this knowledge I need to understand people's needs, thoughts, emotions as well
            motivations that drive them towards improving their fitness.
        </p>
        <h3>Interviews with potential users</h3>
        <p>The empathize stage was an explorative effort, that allowed me to gather as much information as possible,
            through interviews with potential users of the fitness app.
            By combining interviews with research on social media I was able to gather diverse data about people who
            want to improve their fitness.
        </p>
        <p>In order to find interviewees, from various backgrounds, I have reached out to my family and friends as well
            as to people on social media.
            I have found participants for the interview in a facebook group for women who want a
            makeover for their health and fitness, as well as in my personal circle. The aim of each interview was to
            answer the following main questions:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Why</strong> people <strong>want to</strong> exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when they <strong>do</strong> manage to exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when something <strong>prevents</strong> them from
                    exercising?</li>
            </ol>
            During the actual interviews I have asked more than those three questions. How many and which questions
            exactly, depended on the individual interviewee.
            However all questions aimed to result in answers to the above mentioned three main questions.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the interviews I searched for people who documented their fitness story on instagram or
            twitter. The purpose of the social media search was
            to find more data about how people motivate themselves to stick to a workout routine and what challenges
            they were facing during the beginning of their journey.
            <p>The data collected during the interviews, as well as social media reserch, was used to define the problem 
                to be solved in the<a href="#define">Define phase</a>.</p>

            <p>The goal is to develop a clear understanding of <strong>which problem I will attempt to solve for the
                    potential users</strong>. <br>
                The define phase includes the following activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Affinity Diagramm: Analyze and identify the major themes in the data</li>
                <li>Empathy Map: Find out how participants think, feel, talk and react</li>
                <li>Define Personas Point of view to crystalize their needs</li>
                <li>Persona creation</li>

                alt="Affinity Diagramm of the data collected during user interviews">
            <p>I clustered the data from the user interviews into the following main groups. These are not user groups,
                but rather main topics
                of what motivates and prevents people from working out:
                <ol>
                    <li>Underlying health issue: Workout relieves the pain</li>
                    <li>Vanity: People who work out to look good</li>
                    <li>Maintenance: People who want to maintain their agility throughout their lifes</li>
                    <li>Schedule: People workout when they have a schedule and stick to it</li>
                    <li>Lack of commitment: People skip workouts, because they let things get in the way</li>
                    <li>Environmental restrictions: Sometimes a workout is skipped, because of weather, or it would
                        disturb others, etc.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Empathy Map</h3>

                        grow older. They don't solely want to rely on fitness classes, because they like to do different things 
                        and also their own thing every once in a while. However they do let things get in the way and sometimes they prefer
                        to spend their time and energy on other activities like chilling or going out.

            <p>As someone with a busy lifestyle I need motivation to work out regularly because I want to maintain my health, mobility as well as looks

            <p>The purpose of this phase is to generate ideas and solutions. With the help of the point of View statement of the previous chapter,
                I was able to define the following <strong>"How might we questions"</strong> to crystalize the users needs:

                These "How might we" questions act as guidance during the ideation sessions, so the team will not lose sight of what is important.
                The ideation techniques applied in this case study are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Competitor Analysis</li>
                    <li>User Flow</li>
                    <li>Brainstorming</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>For the competitor analysis, I have selected a handful of fitness apps and social media apps. I have identified the fitness apps by
                searching for motivating fitness apps. I have decided to include YouTube and Instagram, because both apps are used for the distribution
                of all kinds of workouts as well as diet plans. Additionally Instagram can be used as a diary to track ones progress. The features list in the table below
                are not complete, I am just focusing on features which are relevant for the personas needs.
