        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Being healthy and fit plays an ever increasing role in peoples lifes. However there are various reasons and
            factors that cause people to not work out as regularly as they desire to. The goal is to design a smartphone
            app which will help people to improve their fitness.
            The target group is people who want to exercise more, but who -for various reasons - don't get around to it.

    <h2>Approach: Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>This case study follows along the design thinking process as tought in the <a
        href="https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/design-thinking-the-beginner-s-guide">Design Thinking - The
        Beginner's Guide</a>
        by the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">The Interaction Design Foundation</a> as displayed in the
        image below. </p>

        alt="5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process">
        <p>The Design Thinking process follows covers five stages: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. During the Empathize stage designers 
            perform user research in order to gain an empathetic understanding of the users desires and needs.
            This data is turned into a definite problem statement during the Define stage. A clearly defined problem enables the Ideate stage. During this stage the team
            comes together to brainstorm possible solutions for the problem. The team decides on a possible solution and creates one or more 
            prototypes during the Prototype phase. The prototype(s) are given to a selected user group to test. The tests should generate further insights about the users needs as well as desires and
            initiate design changes. </br>
            The design thinking process is an iterative process and the steps don't necessarly have to be followed in sequence.
            However the appropriate steps should be iterated through until the team comes up with a satisfying design. </br>
            This process is ideal for startups and therefore it was chosen for this project.
        </p>
        <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: To ensure that all data gathered during this design process stays confidential I have omitted
        and appropriated confidential information.</p>

        <p>The goal is to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem I am trying to solve.
            To gain this knowledge I need to understand people's needs, thoughts, emotions as well
            motivations that drive them towards improving their fitness.
        </p>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>In order to get to know and understand the people who are struggling with improving their fitness, I have interviewed different people from various backgrounds.
             I have reached out to my family and friends 
            as well as to people on social media. I have found participants for this interview in a facebook group for women who want a 
            makeover for their health and fitness, as well in my personal circle. The aim of each interview was to answer the following main questions:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Why</strong> people <strong>want to</strong> exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when they <strong>do</strong> manage to exercise</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> concretely happens when something <strong>prevents</strong> them from
                    exercising?</li>
            </ol>
            During the actual interviews I have asked more than those three questions. How many and what questions exactly, depended on the individual interviewee.
            However all questions aimed to result in answers to the above mentioned three main questions. With the data collected during the interviews, I have created
            <a href="#persona1">Personas</a> (fictional characters), which are described in the <a href="#define">Define section</a>. In addition to the interviews, I have
            searched the twittersphere to find more data on what motivates people to work out and why they skip a workout.
